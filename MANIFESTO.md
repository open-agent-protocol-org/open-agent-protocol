# Open Agent Protocol (OAP) – Manifesto

## The Problem

AI agents are becoming more powerful — but increasingly fragmented.

Today:
- Agents are locked inside proprietary ecosystems.
- Developers must build separately for each model provider.
- There is no universal standard for agent manifests, permissions, tools, or runtime compatibility.
- Users cannot move their agents between platforms or runtimes.

This fragmentation risks creating isolated AI silos.

Just like the early internet before open protocols.

## The Vision

We believe AI agents will become as common as mobile applications.

In the coming years, individuals and organizations will rely on multiple agents for:
- Planning and productivity
- Finance and budgeting
- Learning and research
- Health and personal optimization
- Automation and coordination

But these agents must be:

- Portable
- Transparent
- Secure
- Interoperable
- Vendor-neutral

Open Agent Protocol (OAP) exists to make that possible.

## What OAP Is

Open Agent Protocol (OAP) is an open, model-agnostic standard for defining, packaging, and running AI agents.

OAP defines:

- A standardized agent manifest format
- A unified permission taxonomy
- A tool integration interface
- A memory declaration model
- Runtime compatibility requirements

OAP does not belong to any company.

It is an open initiative intended to support a healthy, interoperable AI ecosystem.

## Core Principles

1. Model-agnostic  
2. Runtime-neutral  
3. Permission-transparent  
4. Secure by design  
5. Portable across ecosystems  
6. Developer-first  
7. User-controlled  

---

## What OAP Is Not

OAP is not:

- A marketplace
- A product
- A closed framework
- A corporate-controlled ecosystem

It is a foundational layer for interoperability.

---

## The Long-Term Goal

In 5–10 years, we envision:

- Thousands of agents built according to OAP
- Multiple runtimes supporting OAP
- Cross-platform agent portability
- Enterprise and consumer ecosystems built on open standards
- Reduced vendor lock-in across AI ecosystems

Just as HTTP enabled the web,
OAP aims to enable the agent ecosystem.

## Status

OAP v0.1 – Draft Specification.

This is an early-stage open initiative.
Feedback, discussion, and contributions are welcome.
